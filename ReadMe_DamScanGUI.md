# DamScanGUI - a Companion for DamScan and DamCompare
A Python program serving as a GUI front end for Juha Lintula's DamScan and DamCompare tools to analyze Daminion databases.
  
The functions of DamScan and DamCompare are controlled by command line parameters and/or an options file (.ini).

The purpose of DamScanGUI is to provide a more user friendly interface the a dialog panel - a graphical user interface (GUI).

In addition can create and read multiple .ini files for DamScan and DamCompare to store and recall multiple option sets for various analysis situations.

To use it you only need to store all three files DamScanGUI.py, DamScanGUI_support.py and openfold.gif in the same folder - preferably the same directory where DamScan and/or DamCompare are installed.  

This tool is work in progress written and tested with Python 3.62  based on a tkinter GUI module generated by PAGE version 4.9 by Donald Rozenberg in conjunction with Tcl version 8.6 (Tcl not needed run the Python program).

See README.md, DamCompare.docx, DamScan.docx for the prerequsites of the analysis programs.
