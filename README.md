# DamScan
A Python utility to identify inconsistencies between linked or grouped items in Daminion digital asset management (DAM) system.

Daminion digital asset management (DAM) system is a great tool for assigning meta data (tags) to your digital assets and for sorting and searching the items. In Daminion itâ€™s also possible to link or group associated items together, but there are no built-in tools for checking the consistency of the meta data of these linked or grouped items. DamScan.py solves this problem and reports inconsistencies in meta data for Daminion server and standalone catalogs.

You need to have Python 3.x and psycopg2 installed.
